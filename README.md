The project has been commenced with the overarching objective of constructing a Node.js-based system. This system's primary function is to facilitate the real-time exchange of actions and data amongst multiple clients, leveraging the capabilities provided by the Socket.IO library. In tandem, the project entails the establishment of a robust infrastructure for the enduring storage of actions and data within a MongoDB database. Furthermore, an integral component of this undertaking involves the development of a RESTful web service. This service will expose a suite of API endpoints, meticulously designed to oversee and govern the management of rooms within the overarching system. The collective endeavor aspires to create a comprehensive and seamlessly interconnected collaborative platform that harmoniously accommodates real-time communication, persistent data retention, and versatile room administration
